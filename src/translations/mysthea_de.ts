        <source>Being completely engulfed by the eternal storm of clouds above, Icaion is an extremely cold and dark planet. &lt;strong&gt;Sunlight is one of the most scarce resources&lt;/strong&gt; and this forced civilizations to develop only on the rare places where the sun reaches the ground, allowing them to cultivate lands obtaining steady food supplies impossible to have anywhere else. These spots are so scarce and so far away one from another, that these civilizations never met and are unaware of each other&apos;s existence. The regions that surround the City are mainly barren and there are no other known cities or settlements in them, just Seeker&apos;s outposts to help the process of harvest different kinds of crystals.</source>

The effects of the crystal can vary wildly from one region to another, causing some places to have perennial snowstorms, others are submerged in mist, others are places with eternal rain and so on, with &lt;strong&gt;frightening weather phenomena going on in different regions.&lt;/strong&gt; Those unstable regions offer &lt;strong&gt;different types of Qoam crystals.&lt;/strong&gt; It isn’t known if the instability depends from these crystals or it is the instability itself that altered the crystal.</source>

The absence of storms with the constant sunny daylight makes this &lt;strong&gt;ring of cultivable land excellent for farming&lt;/strong&gt;. Around the fields lies a huge City. Since cultivable land is a finite and extremely rare asset, the City developed in every spot that wouldn’t waste precious soil.</source>

Outside there is the &lt;strong&gt;&apos;region of eternal dusk&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;, an outer circle where the rest of society lives crammed as tightly as possible. All of this is surrounded by a huge wall that encloses the whole City from the dangers present outside. The walls are a mix of natural boundaries which were thrust up by earthquakes when the crystal arose millennia ago, and artificial ones made to fill the gaps.</source>

He carries with him a giant staff in the form of a two-pronged fork. This is also a relic from his solo return. Nobody knows where it is from, how the Lone Survivor came to have it in his possession, nor to what ends it can be put to. Rumour has it that if someone stands close to it they can hear it humming and if you touch it there is shock that burns, but leaves no mark. The Lone Survivor habitually wears a broad-brimmed hat that obscures his face and a long heavy waterproof coat that he wears everywhere.

Therefore the Industrialists decided that it wasn’t possible to recover on their investment and they &lt;strong&gt;sold the design to the Organization&lt;/strong&gt; to recoup the research costs incurred so far.

It &lt;strong&gt;learned how to communicate perfectly in the people’s language in a matter of days,&lt;/strong&gt; showing that it is in its nature to learn almost everything in an extremely short time. This seems to be the peculiarity of this species, they are &lt;strong&gt;able to learn and master even the most complex skill really quickly,&lt;/strong&gt; but unfortunately they can do this only for a few skills at a time. This is not a major problem since they can &lt;strong&gt;forget and relearn things&lt;/strong&gt; so fast that they just end up switching between skills frequently. This huge flexibility made The Creature very interesting to the Organization that started to employ her in as many of the most various tasks as possible. Regardless of the task, the Creature is capable of spending very few days with proficient instructors and it will rapidly learn the assigned skill. The Creature always &lt;strong&gt;carries an object in two of its four hands&lt;/strong&gt; and many people believe that it is this object which conveys it its learning power.</source>

        <source>A mysterious man that was encountered far from the City, deep in the regions during an expedition years ago. A stranger of unknown origins clearly not from anywhere near the City. Although The Outsider is humanoid, &lt;strong&gt;it is speculated among the Seekers that he is not entirely human.&lt;/strong&gt; When he originally made contact with a convoy the Seekers were very wary. Nonetheless, after the initial caution, he was asked to join them after helping with his knowledge of survival skills necessary for the Regions. Eventually he went with them to the headquarters of the Organization outside the City walls. He lived in the wilderness around the walls for a while, until he was approached by the Organization, interested in employing him due to his &lt;strong&gt;great adaptability and expert knowledge of the areas outside&lt;/strong&gt;.</source>

        <source>She’s a convicted criminal that escaped from the City years ago, having a hefty bounty on her head she would be arrested on the spot if she ever set foot in the City again. To survive the wilderness and harshness of the outside regions, she built a set of &lt;strong&gt;armor with thermal capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;, to keep her warm and protected. Being unrecognizable in the armor, she was able to join a Seeker’s convoy and managed to enter the Organization undercover. She did not reveal her identity until she proved her value to the Organization leaders, who then &lt;strong&gt;decided to protect her&lt;/strong&gt; due to her incredible survival and adaptation abilities on the outside. She now lives in the Organization headquarters outside the walls and outside the City jurisdiction.</source>

This was because she always &lt;strong&gt;pushed to the most obscure fringes of science&lt;/strong&gt;, so her results may either be spectacular or fail in spectacular (and sometimes very loud) ways. For her all these failures where just part of &lt;strong&gt;her innovative and rigorous creative method&lt;/strong&gt;, which allowed her to have an edge over her competitors. She didn’t really care about the gossip since she knew that they were only due to ignorance and she always thought that in the end her works would speak for themselves. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case and one day she lost an arm while working on some new innovative contraption that she believed could change Qoam extraction forever. This event really damaged her reputation and people became so entrenched in the conviction that she was cursed. It reached the point where almost nobody would work with her anymore. Forced to find new ways to make a living, she joined the Organization and they were more than happy to disregard all the hearsay and take such a talented individual on board.</source>

        <source>Millenia ago, a planet called Icaion was hit by a giant crystal of unknown origins which came at high speed from the depths of space. With staggering force, the crystal pierced through the planet, ending a long journey from a mysterious place. The impact was so strong that the planet, and the forces governing it, were changed forever.</source>

        <source>On impact, the crystal scattered into shards all over the planet, from the surface to its greatest depths. These crystal shards, called Qoam, have their own magnetic field that reacts oddly with the planet’s gravitational forces. Some Qoam shards float, while others remain firmly solidified on the ground. Some shards are embedded so deeply in stone and other materials that the material itself shares their same properties. 

This cataclysm and displacement had huge consequences on the balance of the forces of the planet, creating anomalies everywhere, bending the laws of physics and spawning unimaginable anomalies. 

One of the two most notable effects of this cataclysm was the blanket of mist and clouds covering the whole surface of the planet, a seemingly endless storm that appeared after the impact and continued for millenia. The second most notable effect was the detachment of large and small chunks of crust from the planet’s surface. Areas as large as continents detached from the planet and began floating around it, pulled by a mysterious gravitational force generated by the Henakor, the largest chunk of crystal still embedded within the center of the planet. The floating islands orbit around Icaion above the cloud layer. 

It took thousands of years for the planet to rebalance itself, if we can truly call it balance even now. In reality, while it’s stable at the moment, this stability is just a temporary truce in an endless fight between the planet’s attempts to restore itself and the constant instability brought on by the unnatural forces of the Henakor.</source>

        <source>Mysthea is the region of lands floating above the clouds. It consists of a great landmass and plenty of smaller islands, including the five main ones that rotate around the Henakor. 

During these long years new life spawned in Mysthea, influenced and corrupted by the power of the crystal and the presence of Qoam. Some of these beings are peaceful creatures, while others react violently to the energy of the crystal. It remains unclear if humans survived the cataclysm or were generated by the anomalies on the planet after the impact, but unquestionably their physical and societal development has been largely influenced by the presence of the crystal. These people developed the ability to attune themselves with Qoam shards and interact with their powers in strange ways. Their society is progressing steadily using Qoam as its main resource. 

In present day, the population above the clouds lives and prospers completely unaware of what lies beneath them. The floating regions of Mysthea, for all its inhabitants know, contain the only human presence in the whole universe. They are just able to see the Henakor sticking out from the perennial storm. From their perspective, it is impossible to tell if it is floating there or if it stretches all the way down to something else below. Scholars have their theories, the faith have others and the common folksmen rely on legends and tales. What is certain is that nobody has ever ventured there.</source>

        <source>The Henakor releases regularly pulsing waves of energy,  twisting everything they happen to hit. Luckily for the inhabitants of Mysthea, they are far enough from the crystal to be out of reach of this energy. From a distance they observe the effects it has on everything within its reach. 

Particularly, there are five floating islands that are stuck in a gravitational force generated by the Henakor. These islands are periodically hit by beams of energy fromthe crystal and are heavily affected. As beholders of this phenomenon they are hypnotized, waiting to be immersed in the next pulse wave. These islands are hazardous places since the crystal causes all kinds of effects on the environment and inhabitants. For the people living on Mysthea the crystal and its odd satellites have always been there, becoming the stuff of tales and legends, both admired and feared, an astonishing and terrifying place that the faith venerates and that scholars can only dream of comprehending.</source>

        <source>People living on Mysthea are naturally able to interact telekinetically with Qoam shards. Some have a more natural predisposition and are able to perform amazing feats, but generally almost anyone is able to sense the presence of Qoam and to move it in small quantities. This telekinetic ability has been used during the development of society in the most creative ways and has shaped the evolution of the whole species. Qoam itself, but more particularly rocks with the crystal embedded in it, have been used for the most diverse applications, from something as simple as a tool to a base material used to build whole cities. The most virtuous and talented Qoam manipulators are able to use it as a weapon, weightless to them and deadly to others. Some are able to walk around covered in otherworldly crystal armor without compromising any mobility. Some even manage to bring these materials to life: using Qoam shards and stones with the crystal embedded in it to generate golems with a will of their own. Everyone manages to find some clever and unique way to use Qoam and this makes it an integral part of the fabric of society. </source>

        <source>The city of Ilvash, capital of the Kingdom of the ruling dynasty Ahatils, is a sprawling city built upon the biggest floating chunk of land in Mysthea. It’s the oldest citiy ever built, and the biggest one. It rules over all other cities and towns, even ones that were once rivaling kingdoms. 

After decades of peace ascribable to the King’s conquest of all opposing states, the ruler decided to delegate the management of the state to the five major Guilds of the city. For each citizen in the kingdom it is mandatory to enroll in the guild that represents the interests of his social class. This system was created to ensure that every citizen’s interests are somehow represented. In reality, it ended up with the guilds fighting between each other for political and economical power in a constant struggle that rarely considers the needs of the population.</source>

        <source>Recently, for the first time ever, Magista, the Guild of Scholars, decided to collaborate with the Faith, represented by the Lusma Guild, to research a new artefact. They hoped this artefact would be able to amplify the people’s power, allowing them to move quantities of Qoam previously unimaginable. The manufacturing of this artefact was extremely difficult and expensive, but they succeeded. This was a huge breakthrough. They created an object that in the right hands would allow people to complete incredible feats. With enough concentration the right mind could now move immense quantities of Qoam, maybe even cities if they chose to. 

Only five artefacts were created, and they were gifted to the five guilds of the capital. They were considered tools of immense power, necessary for the development of the society, to be used with extreme care and responsibility and only for further progress of the species. For a while they were rarely utilized, mostly in ceremonious instances: the power they could bring was so strong that even the elders of the guilds were afraid of possible outcomes. That was, until the moment in which the Merchant Guild realized that with the aid of the artefact they could send an explorer to the islands around the Henakor. For the first time in history, they would be able to explore those new, terrifying and sacred places. The idea started to spread quickly among the whole population: they would finally be able to reach that place of tales and legend. They could touch the lands considered holy by some but damned by others. What would be waiting there? What would happen when they were so close to the Henakor? What answers would they find? What treasure would they be able to bring back?</source>

        <source>The Merchant Guild represents the interests of merchants, bankers, and those involved in commerce. They ensure that taxation remains bearable and goods can travel freely within the Kingdom. Some have speculated those of this guild are richer than the crown and it’s not implausible since wealthy people gladly make voluntary donations in exchange for special considerations.

They were the first guild to understand that with the aid of the artefact and enough concentration, a talented Qoam manipulator could move a Qoam-powered airship from their homeland to the nearest of the five islands, successfully taking an explorer  there, and from this everything started.

Their sole goal is to create wealth. They see the new islands as possible sources of abundant resources and riches. They fund the expedition in hopes of great returns.</source>

They formed this guild when they noticed the King began to delegate power. They understood that if they did not begin to protect their interests, they would lose much in the long term. 

Their power is entirely tied to land ownership but if the people were to stop believing the guild was powerful, they would probably stop being so. They understand the value of land and even more so the value of being the first to obtain it. They finance the exploration of the Henakor because they believe conquest is essential to maintaining their social status and thus their power.</source>

Despite what they say, they hold immense power inside the city walls since the majority of the population is always ready to answer their call. They are the spiritual and religious leaders of this world. They are in the rare position of deciding what is right and what is wrong. More than once they used this power to their own advantage, to the point that a simple threat was enough to get what they wanted. 

They venerate the Henakor, sure that it holds together not only their world, but the entire universe. They are the elected species, since they are the ones living so close to the crystal. They also believe that the Qoam, being parts of a god, are sacred objects that should only be used under certain circumstances and with great care. They chant prayers before using them. In reality, nobody follows their instructions regarding this matter, but this doesn&apos;t stop them from using it as an excuse to persecute troublesome individuals. 

 They are sure that once they reach the Henakor and conquer those lands, their god will finally reward their faith.</source>

They are those in the city that truly understand how manipulation of Qoam actually works. Even if they are just a small group made up of oftentimes peculiar individuals, they are respected. They are the ones that more than once have made discoveries that helped society progress and use crystals more effectively.

The Faith considers them borderline blasphemous, but have always tolerated their presence because they’ve gained much thanks to their discoveries.

When Magista understood that they may be able to create what would later become the artefact, they pitched the idea to the other guilds to gain funding for the research. Only the Faith understood its importance and contributed. In exchange for their funding, they wanted the Scholars to declare publicly that the Faith’s knowledge helped immensely in the creation of the artefact.

They fund expeditions because they believe that proximity to the Henakor could bring breakthroughs in their experiments and because, truly, they are also just curious to discover the wonders of new lands.</source>

        <source>While not technically a guild, this Order represents the Champions the same way the guilds represents the rest of the population. Being a Champion means being on a different level from the rest of the citizens. It’s a title that comes with honors and duties, one of which is the commitment to total political and theological neutrality. It’s said that the Champions first serve the citizens, then serve the guilds, and only after do they serve the kingdom. The Champions are servants of everyone and for this reason it is required for them to be neutral and not join a Guild. For a Champion, being involved in politics could cost him the title. Shinglori is the Order that represents the Champions. With their vow of neutrality, champions must not enter into a guild because this organization is what ensures that the rights and duties of the Kingdom and of the Guilds toward the Champions are always honored. The leader of this guild is decided by election and cannot remain in power for more than a year.</source>

        <source>The whole kingdom buzzed with excitement when the guilds announced that they were going to fund expeditions. Each one would choose a Champion to entrust the artefact to, hiring them to guide an expedition on these new harsh lands. The Champion would represent the interests of the guild in hopes of bringing back great rewards.

“Champion of Ilvash” is a title bestowed to heroes from different backgrounds, with different traits and abilities. Nevertheless, every one of them has shown an extremely high capability in interacting with Qoam and is able to do things that common people would never be able to do. Usually Champions are such masters in manipulating Qoam that over time they build a unique style, specializing in using it in ways that nobody else is capable of replicating.

Champions are revered around the city and live off their talent, selling their services to guilds and private citizens. Even if some of them would join the exploration just for the great monetary compensation, this isn’t the main motivation driving most of them.</source>

        <source>Telron is a feared and respected personality of Ilvash, considered by many the most able Qoam manipulator who ever lived. He’s able to do things with the crystal that leave people speechless. Some swear he’s able to move Qoam so far that in the end, they reach beyond his line of sight. Others claim they have seen him moving an enormous quantity of crystals, enough to build huge structures, by himself. Before the invention of the artefact he was the one that was called upon when something big needed to be moved and no one could manage it.

He’s so able because other than his natural talent, he’s spent years and years studying and researching the source of these powers trying to understand how to improve his abilities. Telron is iron-willed and believes his path must be one of constant improvement. Simply being the best in what he does is not enough; he also must  constantly better himself and his abilities.

He decides to go for the expedition because he believes that in the islands he could find ways to become even stronger.</source>

        <source>Celethe of the family Ahatils was the heiress to the throne of Ilvash. She is the daughter of the King and would have been the rightful owner of the crown when the time came. This was her fate until she renounced her name and refused her rights. Celethe was uninterested in the sort of lifestyle nobles indulge in. She always had a great fascination for Qoam manipulation and great talent for it. But as the life she was born into was predestined for other things, she renounced her birthright to become the apprentice of Telron, the most respected Qoam manipulator. Telron had never had an apprentice, but for Celethe made one exception. When Celethe’s training ended and they parted ways, she managed to use her family name and master’s fame to become a respected manipulator. As revered as Celethe has become, she may one day be the great Telron’s successor. 

Celethe wants to take part in the exploration for her desire of making a name for herself, in order to become stronger that one day she might even surpass her mentor.</source>

        <source>Leheir was once the leader of a rebel group that attempted to overthrow the Crown of a rival state. They wanted to establish a new absurd form of government that would have been rooted to the will of the population. Her organization lingered in the shadows for a long time, plotting and attempting a revolt, but Leheir’s plans and dreams failed when almost all of her group was arrested during a sting and executed on the spot. Alone, she fled to Ilvash to ask for political asylum. The king would concede only if she agreed to use her knowledge of the rival state and its underworld to conquer it in his name. Her original plan for change became the strategy for a military conquest, that succeeded and strengthened another Kingdom. Leheir is cheered as a conqueror in Ilvash, but deep inside she remains full of sorrow and regret for what she not only allowed to happen, but also played a key role in.

Now, she wants to take part in the exploration as an act of redemption, hoping that in this new land there will be something that can bring her happiness once again.</source>

        <source>Sanya grew up near the city walls of Ilvash, an area populated by lower class farmers that traveled daily to farmlands outside the city. Her life was humble, but Sanya has fond memories of those times. Times that abruptly ended the day a Cannibarook attacked the city. On this day a lot of people remained trapped and died below the ruins of the city Walls, including Sanya’s entire family. During this accident, she lost both her legs becoming one of the tragedy’s many victims. Sanya recovered, but losing her family and her mobility took a toll on her that required years to overcome. 

After the accident, a physician from the Magista Guild crafted two prosthesis out of Qoam enable her to walk again. The physician made it out of Qoam so that Sanya would use her mental powers to help her movements. What no one anticipated is how quickly she would learn this skill and how much control she would have over the crystal. It soon became clear that she had an innate talent for Qoam manipulation, since Sanya used her mental powers to boost her movements at an incredibly high speed. After just a few years, Sanya’s control over her Qoam legs become complete and she was able to do things with an unnatural agility. It was just a matter of time before she became a Champion of Ilvash.</source>

        <source>Kolbor and Malabor, known around Ilvash as “the Twins”, refuse to work unless hired together. Very little is known about the Twins, including where they came from. Some stories claim that they arrived from an ancient structure buried beneath the ground, while others say they are from the Five and others even dare to state that they come, somehow, from underneath the clouds. The only thing that is clear is that Kolbor and Malabor made a name for themselves in the shadiest corners of Ilvash.  

Kolbor and Malabor do everything in their daily life in complete synchronicity, harmonizing every movement like two mirror images. They always know what the other does, as if each could read the other’s thought. In reality, this mysterious skill  most likely is due to  the Qoam they have embed in their hands, two symmetrical and identical crystals that resonate at opposite frequencies.

Their behaviour, odd in everyday activities, becomes frightening when they face an enemy. The Twins fight in coordination to the point that they seem to be a single entity, an agile and terrifying being. Their effectiveness during combat, mixed with their unusual appearance and odd behaviour made them famous quickly. They are marked by a stigma of being associated with the Ilvash underworld. Therefore, guilds always make a point to distance themselves from these two brothers.

One day, Kolbor &amp; Malabor were caught breaking into the Varorin’s headquarters, trying to snatch something valuable, most likely for the collection of a wealthy criminal. Varorin officials, known for their savviness, understood that trying to capture these brothers would not end well and decided to let them go without charge for an exchange of work for the guild. The brothers accepted and the problem dissolved quickly and without further issues. What the Varorin official probably had not foreseen when they made this decision was that by law, any citizen that is tasked by a guild to perform extraordinary feats gains the right to bear the Champion name. And so, to the other guilds’ disdain, Kolbor and Malabor entered the same ranks as the other revered Champions of Ilvash.

This did not change the brothers much, and they continued to be odd and secretive individuals closer to the underworld than the rest of the society. But now Kolbor &amp; Malabor can answer the call of the Guilds and carry out remunerative champion tasks.</source>

        <source>CR 2T1, is an ancient machine built by a civilization long gone. This strange invention has mysteriously reactivated itself leaving the whole Kingdom in awe. The Magista are trying to understand what could have caused this strange phenomenon but even more so what the machine was designed to do. But they are far from finding answers.

CR 2T1 was found by Magista fellows during an expedition to some ancient ruins not far from Ilvash. For years the machine was considered nothing more than a strange relic from a past so distant that men could never understand it. CR 2T1 was conserved only as an antiquity in the museum of Ilvash until the day it mysteriously reactivated itself demonstrating  that it is a somewhat sentient, albeit extremely strange, being. The machine operates only to help others fulfill their goals, but only if those goals follow a specific moral code of conduct that CR 2T1 is hardwired with. The code is still impossible to fully comprehend for all the inhabitants of Ilvash. During the time that passed since its activation it has helped all kinds of people and organizations, performing charitable actions, but also violent acts of war. It is unclear what CR 2T1 is trying to accomplish or what for the machine constitutes a worthy task, but exploring the new islands is a call it is ready to answer!</source>

        <source>The world of Icaion is populated by so many creatures and monsters that the discovery of new species is almost expected when venturing far from the city walls. Most creatures are peaceful and even show a great amount of intelligence, to the point that they are accepted inside the city walls and are also given roles in society.

This coexistence between monsters and people is taken for granted by the citizens of Ilvash, but those used to traveling around Icaion know that this is not always the case. Monsters can be unpredictable and even dangerous when exposed to the wild energy of Qoam, to the point that creatures that  normally cooperate in the city, are known to become aggressive in certain areas of the world. Monsters become uncontrollable when hit by energy that vibrates at a certain frequency, but the source of this energy is undetectable. Due to this uncertainty, the army employs these troops only for the defence of the city or in areas where they are sure they are safe from dangerous energies.</source>

        <source>The Onygauros are a species of huge scarab-like monsters with four arms and they are probably the smartest creatures after humans. Onygauros are called “the collectors”, since they live in small caves where they store huge collections of weird items that usually have no value at all for humans, but seem extremely precious to them. Each Onygauros is fascinated by a different kind of item and tend to collect as many variations as possible of that specific item. For example, you might see a Onygauros cave filled with all sorts of bottles and another filled with drawers, cogs, and other bizarre things. Be aware when venturing into their caves because they may become violent to defend their collections. 

Their bizarre behaviour has long been the basis for collaboration with humans, who quickly understood how to please these powerful beasts, making them allies and valuable assets to their armies. While they are excellent warriors due to their size and ability to wield four weapons at once, some are uninterested in engaging in war and can instead be seen trading their strange objects with human merchants. They naturally understand what is valuable to other beings and use this to obtain what they want from each trade.</source>

        <source>Boulron are eerie, elegant creatures that appeared on Mysthea some years ago. Their presence is unsettling to many, especially because they were unknown to man until their surprising appearance one day. It was an odd day. The citizens woke up to see these strange creatures roaming through the city like they’d always lived there. At first this created a panic, but soon the people understood that Boulron did not pose too great a threat.

The creatures move slowly with sinuous, elegant gestures. Boulron roam and observe other beings, but try not to interact. They are considered a sign of bad luck by many because they seem attracted by death. It is not unusual to see Boulron congregate where someone has died, just to standfor hours in what seems a form of sorrow.

Another sign of their dark nature is their habit, while roaming, to become suddenly attracted by and follow soldiers, mercenaries, or anyone who has had an encounter with death recently.

In the wild not only is their behaviour unsettling and unpredictable, but the idea that crystal energy can enrage them at any moment is a cause for great fear. Boulron are known to forget their calm and slow movement and to become machines of war when triggered by the crystals, capable of destroying entire armies at once.</source>

        <source>Caerulas, nicknamed “the inhabitant from below”, is a strange three-headed creature that appears from the storm. Usually it tends to appear from the clouds, fly over the floating island while screeching strange harmonic sounds, then disappearing back below. Its appearance is similar to the rest of the mist that surrounds the planet, and it is not clear if Caerulas is made of the same or if the cloud sticks to its body as it travels through it. Caerulas  seems to ignore humanity and all living beings. It’s most important goal is to fly freely around Icaion. 

Some scholars studying Caerulas more closely reported there had actually been some interactions between Caerulas and humans. But these reports are strange, like tales of madmen, and all uncannily similar to each other. Once they had Caerulas’ attention, the raconteurs felt that Caerulas was staring directly into their souls, comprehending every detail of their existence before quickly disappearing into the skies. This is what is reported by those who survived the encounter, since there are also many reports of people being brutally slaughtered by Caerulas, perhaps people whose souls may not have impressed the creature.</source>

        <source>Obsidusa is a walking abomination fused with Qoam. The story goes that he captures unfortunate adventurers and proceeds to absorb the victims, engulfing them in his own body made by flesh and remnants of other people that were unable to fight him. It is said he was once human. Obsidusa is not the only abomination infused with Qoam that roams the lands of Mysthea. Horrors of all kinds with Qoam embed in their flesh turn up often and their origin is a chapter of Ilvash history that most people prefer to not remember.

That sad history starts with a Champion that disappeared in mysterious circumstances during the Great War of Dulkodel. The Champion was known for making strange experiments with Qoam, involving other living creatures. The experiments were unethical and at some point almost all the guilds decided to cut ties with him. Kaetur was the only guild interested in his services, using his “inventions” and discoveries in battle. His experiments may have been unethical, but they created things of great power, irreplicable by other means. During the Great War, he was given unlimited freedom and resources to pursue his research, as the philosophy of “victory at any cost” was normal during those times and justified practices that today would only be considered mad. Until one day toward the end of the war he suddenly went missing along with much of the equipment from his laboratory. Some speculate that he escaped to avoid risk of being persecuted for the unspeakable things he did during the war; others think that he needed to throw off any pressure from society to pursue his mad research. No one has seen him since that day, but shortly after creatures never seen before appeared in Mysthea disseminating horror everywhere they turn up. Abominations with the likes of Obsidusa are just the waste of his experiments, thrown away when they no longer serve a use to him.</source>

        <source>Cannibarok is a huge and dangerously stupid creature that lives only to satisfy his most basic needs. He feeds himself off Qoam and little else matters to this great beast. Cannibarok seems to be able to sense Qoam, even at a great distance, and when he reaches it he uses his multiple mouths to feed himself with the precious Crystal. 

It is possible to tell the age of a Qoam Eater by his size, since the diet seems to have an effect on the growth of the beast. Usually Qoam Eaters do not live more than a decade, but during this time they can grow to incredible proportions, which poses a great risk for everyone around them. Sometimes these Qoam Eaters enter unnoticed into caves filled with Crystal and come out many years later, having grown to gigantic proportions from feasting on the crystals within and henceforth wreaking havoc on their path toward some new Qoam field. For this reason the Kaetur Guild monitors closely the presence of Cannibaroks around cities and settlements,trying to exterminate the creatures before they grow too large. This movement started after an enormous Cannibarook entered the walls of Ilvash, attracted by the Qoam embedded in almost every building of the city. He destroyed a large portion of the city and a day of fighting ensued before Champions and soldiers were able to bring down the beast.</source>

        <source>Kodror is a unique kind of mold-like lifeform that seems to develop and grow only when in contact with Qoam. Highly toxic and caustic for all kinds of living creatures, Kodror takes its nutrients by attaching itself to living beings and killing them. It rarely creates issues on the ground since it usually gets eradicated before it can grow to any considerable amount. But a situation can become deadly when Kodror grows on large chunks of floating Qoam, since Kodror does not become noticeable until it is already dangerously large. At that point Kodror becomes a frightening, floating abomination with huge  tentacles that reach to kill anything passing below them.</source>

        <source>Utcoros are predatory beasts with a short lifespan of just a couple of months. They hatch from eggs and immediately begin to hunt for sustenance. Utcoros try to kill and eat almost anything they encounter, if their size allows it. If their size does not allow it, they tend to aggregate themselves in packs to swarm and overwhelm their prey. Utcoros continuously hunt until they are ready to lay eggs. When this happens, it means that their life span is near its end. Utcoros die on top of their offspring, so that their toxic dead bodies can protect their eggs from the elements and from any other predators until the eggs hatch and the cycle repeats. 

They are sometimes used by soldiers and militias of Mysthea as a sort of rite of passage: after their training young recruits are required to kill them as a test of courage and strength. For this reason military veterans see fleeing in front of them as an act of cowardice, an admission of weakness and unpreparedness.</source>

        <source>The process of manipulating Qoam to move it telekinetically is common practice for all of the city. The practice is considered as natural as breathing. In reality the process is very complex, but only some are aware of this or are able to use this knowledge to their advantage. Highly talented individuals put a lot of concentration into what they do. For them, the goal is to sense crystals whose electromagnetic fields vibrate at a frequency that works well for them. Finding such a crystal makes a great difference, as choosing the right crystal can make the process immensely easier, enabling the user to perform greater feats. Usually, when one is interacting with a Qoam, others cannot take control of it unless the first user allows them to do so.</source>
